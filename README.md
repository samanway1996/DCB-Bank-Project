# DcbBank-Project

OUR SOLUTION IS TO MAKE BANKING AND TRANSACTION POSSIBLE EVEN WHEN THE DEVICE HAS NO INTERNET CONNECTION. WHEN THE DEVICE BE ONLINE , THE PERSON CAN SEND MONEY TO THE PERSON FROM WALLET TO WALLET, AND FOR THIS WE NEED TO DESIGN A WALLET IN THE APPLICATION OF THE BANK, AND MONEY CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO OR FROM THE WALLET TO THE REGISTERED ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FREE OF COST IN PRESENCE OF INTERNET. NOW FOR MAKING TRANSACTION AND BANKING POSSIBLE EVEN IN A DEVICE WITH NO INTERNET CONNECTION, WE CAN START A SERVER WHICH WILL BE DEDICATED TO RECEIVE CALL REQUESTS FROM USER. THE PROCESS WILL BE LIKE THE USER , WHO WANTS TO SEND MONEY TO ANOTHER USER, WILL SEND A SMS OR MAKE A PHONE CALL, ENTER THE NUMBER OF RECEIVER , REGISTERED WITH HIS WALLET, ALONG WITH THE AMOUNT TO BE TRANSFERRED, THE SERVER WILL AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFER MONEY FROM SENDER'S WALLET TO RECEIVER'S WALLET. THIS WAS THE USER CAN KNOW HIS MINI STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT BY REQUESTING THE SERVER BY SMS, AND THE SERVER WILL SEND THE USER THE MINI STATEMENT.
